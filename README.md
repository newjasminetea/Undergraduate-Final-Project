# Undergraduate-Final-Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for my undergraduate thesis project, which focuses on designing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for the classification of melanoma lesions from dermoscopic skin images.
Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer, and early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. CNNs have demonstrated remarkable performance in image classification tasks, making them a promising tool for automated skin lesion analysis.
In this project, I propose a CNN architecture called MelanomaNet-V1, which consists of five convolutional layers for feature extraction and three dense layers for classification. The model is trained and evaluated using the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) 2017 dataset, which includes dermoscopic images of melanoma, nevus, and seborrheic keratosis lesions.
Key features of this project:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset characteristics and distribution.
Preprocessing techniques such as image normalization, resizing, and data augmentation to enhance model performance.
Design and implementation of the MelanomaNet-V1 architecture using TensorFlow and Keras.
Architectural analysis using feature map visualization and saliency mapping to interpret the model's learning process and decision-making.
Model training and evaluation, including a comparison with the well-known AlexNet architecture.
Discussion of results, limitations, and potential future improvements.

Through this project, I aim to contribute to the development of automated tools for the early detection of melanoma, which can assist dermatologists in making more accurate and timely diagnoses.
Please refer to the code files, Jupyter notebooks, and documentation in this repository for more details on the methodology, implementation, and results of this project. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions for improvement.
